\* This is only pertinent to courses in the `jhudsl` organization. 

To help learners find your course, and for it to be tracked in the future, you may want to consider adding the course to the jhudsl course library.

You should not worry about adding the course before it is ready to be made public but this issue is to remind you to do so.

[Follow these instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Release-a-course-for-public-viewing) to add this new course to the jhudsl library.
